At the bottom of the file there's a class with parameter and comment
"Insert choice 1-9 for each type of Arts you wanted to display"
named "Polyrun" insert number 1-9 to choose which arts you want in the parameter
like this:

Polyrun(1) # for choice 1

Polyrun(5) #for choice 5

For the report, as I had written this code, there's no existing bug yet. 
if inserting the number within the range 1-9 there should be no problem.
